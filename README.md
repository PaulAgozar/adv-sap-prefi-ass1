1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
	- Service Oriented Architecture is a design pattern that attempts to use various services to create complete applications such as those used in business, education, and other platforms.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
	Characteristics of SOAs are:
		- Loosely connected since they were designed to reduce the dependency of multiple systems. 
		- The second is location-transparent, because the services may be reached from anywhere inside the network, regardless of where it is placed. 
		- The final characteristic is that it is self-contained and is intended to accomplish an identified purpose.

3. Define Microservices.
	- Microservices is an another structural form of service oriented architecture is microservices. It is an architectural pattern that organizes loosely connected and other application services. One of its goals is for teams to be able to create and supply services for one another.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
	The advantages of employing microservices includes:
		- The convenience because a microservice may be added, removed, or updated.
		- Developers may deploy features that avoid failures
		- It is also fault-tolerant microservices that assist increase infrastructure resilience. 

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
	SOA
		- It is intended to divide resources among them, because of the bigger and more modular services are not independent of one another.
		- It usually includes the sharing of components.
		- It contains governance standards that apply to the entire team.
	Microservices
		- It is intended to host services that may operate independently.
		- There is no sharing of service components.
		- It necessitates team cooperation in order to have the freedom to determine which governance measures the service employs.
